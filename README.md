# wordle-clone-website
created a wordle website using HTML, CSS, JS
This is a basic clone of wordle website website which is inspired by the original website of "THE NEWYORK TIMES".
Game Interface: The website would likely feature a clean and user-friendly interface where players can interact with the game. It would display the five-letter word that needs to be guessed and provide a space for players to enter their guesses.
